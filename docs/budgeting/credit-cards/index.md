# Managing Credit Cards - Within the Budget

Using a credit card in any budgeting software can be confusing, and Actual is no different. Of all the questions that are asked about budgeting, credit card usage is near the top of the list so don't feel bad if you're a little confused. 

:::note
Any Revolving Credit Account that has both purchases and payments in any month should be treated as a credit card, not as a loan. Use [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) if the balance is not paid off every month.
:::

:::warning
We recommend that you place all your credit card accounts **On Budget**. You can [close](/docs/accounts/index.md#closing-or-deleting-an-account) an on budget account when you are through with it (and reopen, if necessary) but you **cannot** change an off budget account to on budget! _Only_ set a credit card account to Off Budget and treat it as a loan if there will be _no_ new purchases and the account will be closed once it's paid off.
:::

If you pay off your credit card statement every month, then you will want to use this page to understand how Actual helps you work with your credit card to stay _Within the Budget_. In this case, you will _**not**_ create a Budget category for this credit card.

If you are unable to budget for and pay your credit card outstanding balance then we also have you covered, see the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) page for a step-by-step guide on how to set up Actual and track this debt in a safe and sustainable manner. Follow what we describe down below for any new credit card purchases.

We highly recommend you follow this _Within the Budget_ strategy. _Every_ time you make a credit card purchase, enter the transaction and select a category with money set aside in the Budgeted column and a positive Budget Balance. As long as you do not overspend in any category you will not incur any new debt and can pay the credit card bill in full whenever it arrives. 

If you _do_ need to overspend a category for an emergency purchase, that's OK, life happens. Read through and follow the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) strategy to sustainably pay off this new debt.

:::tip
Be aware that when you do not pay **at least** the statement balance by the due date, you will lose your "Grace Period" and incur interest from the date of purchase for all new purchases. It may take a few months of paying your statement balance in full to gain back your Grace Period. 
:::

If you have recently moved to Actual from nYNAB, you will notice that Actual doesn't use specific "credit card" accounts, nor does it have a specific Credit Card Group in the Budget. Actual shows credit card account balances as a negative value and subtracts them directly from your Available Funds. If you don't budget funds you don't have and don't spend money that is not covered in your budget, you will always have enough funds to pay your credit card New Purchases every month!

### Credit card "rules" to stay _Within the Budget_:
- Never overbudget. Only budget funds you actually have!
- Check your category balance _before_ spending.
- Enter your new purchase transactions quickly.
- Cover all overspending.
- Reconcile your accounts at least monthly.
- Pay _at least_ your statement New Balance before the due date.
- A "Credit Limit" is _not_ an invitation to spend it!

## Example

We started our budget at the beginning of July and we normally pay off our Chase Credit Card statement every month. We had some new transactions from June, so we entered a Starting Balance of $35.00. Notice that money we _owe_ goes into the "Payment" column.

Every time we use the card, we choose a category with a positive Budget Balance. Our account closes on the 7th of every month and our statement arrives s few days later. When the July statement arrives, our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 094425" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb18d392-ec50-4dd3-afb3-654df71a3984" />

:::note
See [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) for instructions on how we set up our account display. You can see examples of how we dealt with our other two debt carrying credit cards, too.
:::

Our July statement looks something like this:

**Chase Account Summary - July 2025**
- Statement Period: June 7, 2025 – July 7, 2025
- Account Number: 4424 9012 5678 1234
- Credit Limit: $5,000.00
- Available Credit: $
- Previous Balance: $564.23
- Payments Received: $564.23
- New Purchases: $93.23
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $0.00
- New Balance: $93.23
- Payment Due Date: July 16, 2025
- Minimum Payment Due: $25.00

When we reconcile our account for this first month, we clear all of the June purchases (which should be part of the "Starting Balance") in one lump. In our case they add up to $35.00.

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 095529" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7eab88-5c2a-410f-aa0c-b3676f86c24d" />

We know that we accounted for all of these purchases as none of our Budget categories are overspent and our "To Budget" amount in the Budget header is **not** less than 0.00.  We can pay our statement New Balance without worry, so we send Chase $93.23 from Ally Savings and we transfer that amount as a deposit to our Chase account.

We continue to spend in July, sometimes using our Chase card and _always_ categorizing each transaction to a category with a positive Budget Balance, thereby spending _Within the Budget_.

At the end of July, our Budget looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 095734" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/389eb66e-83bc-4526-bb7c-493c75dd9f9c" />

<br><br>

Our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 100351" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd022c0-294a-42cb-973e-a11b8090e1b3" />

<br><br>

We set up our August Budget on the 1st and it looks a lot like our July Budget. We continue to spend and categorize each transaciton _Within the Budget_ and when our August statement arrives on the 12th, our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 100829" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62922d23-38f0-4937-8d08-c083d8fe13bb" />

**Chase Account Summary - August 2025**
- Statement Period: July 7, 2025 – August 7, 2025
- Account Number: 4424 9012 5678 1234
- Credit Limit: $5,000.00
- Available Credit: $
- Previous Balance: $93.23
- Payments Received: $93.23
- New Purchases: $213.15
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $0.00
- New Balance: $213.15
- Payment Due Date: August 16, 2025
- Minimum Payment Due: $25.00

We reconcile our account and it now looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 101142" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/563968c9-6b1c-44e5-b291-c69aa3b8d43d" />

<br><br>

Becasue we have been categorizing every new purchase to a category with a positive Budget Balance _Within the Budget_, we know that we can pay for them. We can choose to pay either the statement New Balance of $213.15 or our current balance of $219.27. Perhaps you're like many of us and you have your account set to auto-pay the statement balance every month on the due date. Enter that transfer transaction on the due date.

:::tip
If you use a Schedule for your auto-pay, edit the payment amount in your next Schedule to equal your statment New Balance.
:::

Our Chase account now looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 104757" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6066c46-de06-4d4e-9321-3663887379d7" />

<br><br>

on the 18th, our Budget looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 105403" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230cdd9f-dc31-402b-b59f-4a62581880f4" />

<br><br>

:::tip
To pay for a large purchase with your credit card, make a new category for it and add to it's **Budgeted** column every month until you have enough to pay for the purchase. Then you can make the purchase without the worry of going into debt. You'll know you have enough money to pay the bill when it comes as you'll categorize it to a category with a positive Budget Balance without creating Overspending _Within the Budget_.

### Conclusion

Hopefully after looking through this example you've seen that managing credit card spending safely can be pretty easy with a little bit of planning.

On the other hand if some emergency comes up where you are unable to pay off the entire credit card statement, then you've overspent your money and are now in debt. This is perfectly okay, but it means that you need to switch over to following the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) strategy for managing this debt.
