# Managing Credit Cards

Using a credit card in any budgeting software can be confusing, and Actual is no different. Of all the questions that are asked about budgeting, credit card usage is near the top of the list so don't feel bad if you're a little confused.

On this page we will walk you through how to manage a credit card "within the budget". We highly recommend you follow this strategy. Using a credit card within the budget means that every time you make a credit card purchase, you enter the transaction and select a category with money set aside in the Budgeted column. This means that as long as you do not overspend in any category you will not incurring any new debt and are able to pay the credit card bill in full whenever it arrives. 

If you already have a preexisting credit card balance that you haven't budgeted for then we also have you covered, see the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) page to find out how to track this debt in a safe and sustainable manner. Try to follow what we describe down below for any new credit card purchases.

Be aware that when you do not pay **at least** the statement balance by the due date, you will lose your "Grace Period" and incur interest from the date of purchase for all new purchases. It may take a few months of paying your statement balance in full to gain back your Grace Period.

## Scenario

Below we're going to describe a scenario showing you how you can safely use a credit card without racking up any debt. There's a lot of text in the following sections but don't worry, actually implementing this strategy is very easy.


### Setup {#scenario-setup}

To start with we create two **On Budget** accounts, **Checking** and **Credit Card**, both with a starting balance of $0. 

In this scenario we have a monthly salary of $1000 and want to buy a new laptop for $500. Since we don't have any savings set aside for making this purchase, we create a Budget Category called **New Laptop** where we will save up the money for the purchase.


### Month 1 {#scenario-month-1}

It's the first day of the month and our salary was deposited into our checking account, so we create a transaction depositing $1000 into the Income category.

We enter our expenses for the month into the Budgeted column and find that we can assign $250 left over in our **To Budget** to the **New Laptop** category. Since the category balance is so far only $250, the purchase will have to wait until another month.

At the end of Month 1 our budget looks like this:
- **Rent** category has 0. We wrote a $500 check for rent.
- **Food** category has 0. We bought food with our credit card.
- **New Laptop** category has a balance of 250.
- **Checking** account has a balance of 500.
- **Credit Card** account has a balance of -250 as we used it to buy Food.

### Month 2 {#scenario-month-2}

The first of the second month rolls around and we receive our salary again, and just as last month we create a deposit of $1000 into the Income category.

Our expenses are the same, so we are able to budget $250 to the **New Laptop** category. This means that we finally have a balance of $500 in the **New Laptop** category and we can make the purchase we were looking forward to. We are so excited to buy the laptop using our credit card that we buy it a day before the statment closing date. We put the transaction in the **Credit Card** account and categorize it in the **New Laptop** category.

When the credit card bill comes a few days later, our budget now looks like this:
- **Rent** category has 0. We wrote a $500 check for rent.
- **Food** category has 225. We pulled cash out of our checking account for lunches.
- **New Laptop** category has a balance of 0 since we just used the whole balance for the purchase.
- **Checking** account has a balance of 975.
- **Credit Card** account has a balance of -750.

When we receive the credit card bill, the statement balance is $750. Since we know that we didn't overspend in any category, we know that we have the money to pay the $750, so we pay the bill in full with no worries. 

We account for this in Actual by creating a transfer from our **Checking** account to the **Credit Card** account for $750, and our budget now looks like this:
- **Rent** category has 0.
- **Food** category has 225.
- **New Laptop** category has a balance of 0.
- **Checking** account has a balance of 225. This is just the amount we need to eat the rest of the month.
- **Credit Card** account has a balance of 0.

Since we made sure to only spend money that we already had assigned in our Budget, we were able to use the credit card to make a large purchase without any worries of incurring debt!


### Conclusion

Hopefully after reading this example scenario you've seen that managing credit card spending safely can be pretty easy with a little bit of planning.

On the other hand if some emergency comes up where you are unable to pay off the entire credit card statement, then you've overspent your money and are now in debt. This is perfectly okay, but it means that you need to switch over to following the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) strategy for managing this debt.
