# Managing Credit Cards - Within the Budget

Using a credit card in any budgeting software can be confusing, and Actual is no different. Of all the questions that are asked about budgeting, credit card usage is near the top of the list so don't feel bad if you're a little confused. 

:::note
Any Revolving Credit Account that has both purchases and payments in any month should be treated as a credit card, not as a loan. Use [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) if the balance is not paid off every month.
:::

:::warning
We recommend that you place all your credit card accounts **On Budget**. You can [close](/docs/accounts/index.md#closing-or-deleting-an-account) an On Budget account when you are through with it (and reopen, if necessary) but you **cannot** change an Off Budget account to On Budget! _Only_ set a credit card account to Off Budget and treat it as a loan if there will be _no_ new purchases and the account will be closed once it's paid off.
:::

If you pay off your credit card statement every month, then you will want to use this page to understand how Actual helps you work with your credit card to stay _Within the Budget_. In this case, you will _**not**_ create a Budget category for this credit card.

If you are unable to budget for and pay your credit card outstanding balance then we also have you covered, see the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) page for a step-by-step guide on how to set up Actual and track this debt in a safe and sustainable manner. 

**tl;dr. If you don't budget funds you don't have and don't spend money that is not covered in your budget, you will not incur any new debt and always have enough funds to pay for your new credit card purchases whenever you want!**

Actual treats credit card accounts like any bank account, but with a negative value. These negative account balances are subtracted from your positive deposit account balances to give your available "On Budget" funds. As you make purchases with your credit card, the credit card account balance goes further into the negative, thus reducing your available "On Budget" balance. The same thing happens when you pay a utility bill or make a purchase from a checking account - the available "On Budget" balance decreases. When you categorize these expeditures from a budget category with a positive balance, you determine from what envelope the money comes. Since you only put real money in the envelopes at the start of the month, you know you have enough to cover the expenditures regardless of what account they came from.

When you transfer money from On Budget to On Budget accounts, the On Budget balance stays the same, it doesn't matter what type of account it is. When you make a credit card payment (transfer), you bring the credit card account balance closer to $0.00 and your checking account closer to $0.00 by the exact same amount, but in opposite directions! You will move the same amount of money out of your checking account just as if you made those purchases with your checking debit card, you'll just do it a bit later, when the credit card statement comes. Remember, the purchases are deducted from the budget when you assign them a category.

:::note[Here's an example that may help:]

Imagine you have a checking account with $1,000, and Savings with $4,000, so you have a total of $5,000 in the budget.

You spend $50 on a new jacket using your checking debit card, from your funded Clothing category. The money leaves the budget, the checking account balance drops to $950. The total On Budget balance is now $4,950.

If you want to top up the checking back to $1,000 you just make a transfer of $50 from Savings to Checking. You don't need a category, since the On Budget balance doesn't change. You could transfer any amount over, and it wouldn't matter.

Now imagine the same scenario, but the Checking balance starts at $0, and Savings is $5,000. You still have the same On Budget balance of $5,000.

After the transaction, Checking is -$50, but the On Budget balance is the same $4,950 as above. And just like before, you can transfer any amount over without affecting that total balance, so the transfer doesn't need a category. You could move as much as you want, but it only takes $50 to get the account back to zero.

That's all that a CC account is, as far as Actual is concerned. It's the same as any other account, you just choose to let the balance go negative.
:::

We highly recommend you follow the _Within the Budget_ strategy for credit card use. _Every_ time you make a credit card purchase, enter the transaction and select a category with money set aside in the Budgeted column and a positive Budget Balance. As long as you do not overspend in any category you will not incur any new debt and can pay the credit card bill in full whenever it arrives. 

If you _do_ need to overspend a category for an emergency purchase, that's OK, life happens. Read through and follow the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) strategy to sustainably pay off this new debt.

### Credit card "rules" to stay _Within the Budget_:
- Never overbudget. Only budget funds you actually have!
- Check your category balance _before_ spending.
- Enter your new purchase transactions quickly.
- Cover all overspending.
- Reconcile your accounts at least monthly.
- Pay _at least_ your statement New Balance before the due date.
- A "Credit Limit" is _not_ an invitation to spend it!

## Example

To show more top level information about your budget, hover over the top left corner of the header and press the expand arrows:

We started our budget at the beginning of July and we normally pay off our Chase Credit Card statement every month. We had some new transactions from June, so we entered a Starting Balance of $35.00. Notice that money we _owe_ goes into the "Payment" column.

Every time we use the card, we choose a category with a positive Budget Balance. Our account closes on the 7th of every month and our statement arrives a few days later. When the July statement arrives, our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 094425" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb18d392-ec50-4dd3-afb3-654df71a3984" />

:::note
See [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) for instructions on how we set up our account display. You can see examples of how we dealt with our other two debt carrying credit cards, too.

We'll need the following informaiton from our July statement:

**Chase Account Summary - July 2025**
- Previous Balance: $564.23
- Payments Received: $564.23
- New Purchases: $93.23
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $0.00
- New Balance: $93.23

:::note
If necessary, remember to enter a transaction for any interest and or fees charged and categorize them to a funded budget category.

:::

When we reconcile our account for this first month, we clear all of the June purchases and payments (which should be part of the "Starting Balance") in one lump. In our case their sum is $35.00.

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 095529" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7eab88-5c2a-410f-aa0c-b3676f86c24d" />

We know that we accounted for all of these purchases as none of our Budget categories are overspent and our "To Budget" amount in the Budget header is **not** less than 0.00.  We can pay our statement New Balance without worry, so we send Chase $93.23 from Ally Savings and we transfer that amount as a deposit to our Chase account.

We continue to spend in July, sometimes using our Chase card and _always_ categorizing each transaction to a category with a positive Budget Balance, thereby spending _Within the Budget_.

At the end of July, our Budget looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 095734" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/389eb66e-83bc-4526-bb7c-493c75dd9f9c" />

<br><br>

Our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 100351" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd022c0-294a-42cb-973e-a11b8090e1b3" />

<br><br>

We set up our August Budget on the 1st and it looks a lot like our July Budget. We continue to spend and categorize each transaciton _Within the Budget_ and when our August statement arrives on the 12th, our Chase account looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 100829" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62922d23-38f0-4937-8d08-c083d8fe13bb" />

**Chase Account Summary - August 2025**
- Previous Balance: $93.23
- Payments Received: $93.23
- New Purchases: $213.15
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $0.00
- New Balance: $213.15

We reconcile our account and it now looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 101142" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/563968c9-6b1c-44e5-b291-c69aa3b8d43d" />

<br><br>

Because we have been categorizing every new purchase to a category with a positive Budget Balance _Within the Budget_, we know that we can pay for them. We can choose to pay either the statement New Balance of $213.15 or our current balance of $219.27. Perhaps you're like many of us and you have your account set to auto-pay the statement balance every month on the due date. Enter that transfer transaction on the due date.

:::tip
If you use a Schedule for your auto-pay, edit the payment amount in your next Schedule to equal your statment New Balance.

Our Chase account now looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 104757" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6066c46-de06-4d4e-9321-3663887379d7" />

<br><br>

on the 18th, our Budget looks like this:

<img width="100%" height="100%" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-14 105403" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230cdd9f-dc31-402b-b59f-4a62581880f4" />

<br><br>

:::tips
To pay for a large purchase with your credit card, make a new category for it and add to it's **Budgeted** column every month until you have enough to pay for the purchase. When you make the purchase, categorize it to this new category and you'll know you have enough money to pay the bill when it comes. You did not create Overspending and stayed _Within the Budget_.

Be aware that when you do not pay **at least** the statement balance by the due date, you will lose your "Grace Period" and incur interest from the date of purchase for all new purchases. It may take a few months of paying your statement balance in full to gain back your Grace Period. 

If you have recently moved to Actual from nYNAB or some other budgeting apps, you will notice that Actual doesn't use specific "credit card" accounts. Read through how Actual treats credit cards above and follow the examples here and in [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) to learn how Actual handles credit cards.

### Conclusion

Hopefully after looking through this example you've seen that managing credit card spending safely can be pretty easy.

On the other hand if some emergency comes up where you are unable to pay off the entire credit card statement, then you've overspent your money and are now in debt. This is perfectly okay, but it means that you need to switch over to following the [Carrying Debt](./carrying-debt.md) strategy for managing this debt.
